### About
This game was made in a very short time (2 hours) and showcases working with cells as pixels using a Nintendo Game Boy inspired design as well as how to store game data in the Excel sheet instead of in pre-defined classes.

### How to play
Turn on the game by pressing the on/off button on the right side of the Game Boy. Use the arrow buttons on the game boy to navigate and the 'A' button to activate a portal you are standing on. Find your way to the end using the correct portals.

### Hidden Cells
To view the hidden data unprotect the sheet and then set the text color of the cells to the right and the left of the Game Boy to something visible. Game data is stored on the left while level data is stored on the right.

### Portal Map
